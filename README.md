# TrainScheduler

How the app works:

The app dynamically generates table with the values from user input data (train-name, destination ... etc)
This app calculates when the next train will arrive relative to the current time.
The user input data is stored in firebase database; data can be removed (if needed)

Built With:

Bootstrap - for HTML/CSS framework; 
jQuery- logic scripting;
Moment.js- for time conversion into (hh:mm);
Firebase- for database to store content.
